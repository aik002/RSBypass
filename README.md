# WARNING! macOS Sequoia 15.4 is confirmed to entirely break the game!
Do NOT update to 15.4 if you care about Rocksmith 2014 working.
The issue is independent from the patch and also happens on a vanilla unmodified install of the game.

# RSBypass
Rocksmith 2014 uses a DSA signature to verify the authenticity of songs.
This app is a runtime patch for Rocksmith 2014 OSX which allows playing
custom CDLC content.
