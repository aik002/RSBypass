# WARNING! macOS Sequoia 15.4 is confirmed to entirely break the game!
Do NOT update to 15.4 if you care about Rocksmith 2014 working.
The issue is independent from the patch and also happens on a vanilla unmodified install of the game.

# macOS Tahoe 26 as of Beta 5 fixes the game again (???)
The inner workings of macOS are incomprehensible, but the work on the patch is mysterious and important. The latest patch works on the beta, I'll test it again on the release candidate build of macOS 26 and if needed recompile/fix the patch before making an actual release.

# RSBypass
Rocksmith 2014 uses a DSA signature to verify the authenticity of songs.
This app is a runtime patch for Rocksmith 2014 OSX which allows playing
custom CDLC content.
